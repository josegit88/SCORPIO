Welcome to SCORPIO's documentation!
===================================

.. Escribir una descripcion corta del proyecto aca:

**SCORPIO** (Sky COllector of galaxy Pairs and Image Output) It is an application that generates images of pairs of galaxies, in different surveys and filters.

This project is written in Python 3 (to use in Python 2, slight modifications must be made to the input functions, nothing difficult). To use some of the SCORPIO scripts and functions you need on your computer (It is suggested to create a virtual environment if you do not want some of these packages to be permanently hosted in your most used libraries):

numpy, astropy, matplotlib

astroquery: The latest version of astroquery can be conda or pip installed: conda install -c astropy astroquery or pip install astroquery
SCORPIO is a tool to quick generate images of astrophysical objects
