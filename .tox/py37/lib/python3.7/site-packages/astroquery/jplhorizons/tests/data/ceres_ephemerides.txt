Column meaning:

TIME

  Times PRIOR to 1962 are UT1, a mean-solar time closely related to the
prior but now-deprecated GMT. Times AFTER 1962 are in UTC, the current
civil or "wall-clock" time-scale. UTC is kept within 0.9 seconds of UT1
by introduction of integer leap-seconds for 1972 and later.

  Conversion from the internal Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB) to the
non-uniform civil UT time-scale requested for output has not been determined
for UTC times after the next July or January 1st. Therefore, the last known
leap-second is used as a constant over future intervals.

  Time tags refer to the UT time-scale conversion on Earth regardless of
where the observer is located in the solar system. For example, if an
observation from the surface of another body has an output time-tag of
12:31:00 UT, it refers to a time-scale conversion from TDB to UT valid
at the center of the Earth at that instant, not the observer's location
elsewhere in the solar system, where clock rates may differ slightly due
to the local gravity field and there is no precisely defined or adopted
"UT" analog.

  Any 'b' symbol in the 1st-column denotes a B.C. date. First-column blank
(" ") denotes an A.D. date. Calendar dates prior to 1582-Oct-15 are in the
Julian calendar system. Later calendar dates are in the Gregorian system.

  NOTE: "n.a." in output means quantity "not available" at the print-time.

STATISTICAL UNCERTAINTIES

  Output includes formal +/- 3 standard-deviation statistical orbit uncertainty
quantities. There is a 99.7% chance the actual value is within given bounds.
These statistical calculations assume observational data errors are random. If
there are systematic biases (such as timing, reduction or star-catalog errors),
results can be optimistic. Because the epoch covariance is mapped using
linearized variational partial derivatives, results can also be optimistic for
times far from the solution epoch, particularly for objects having close
planetary encounters.

 R.A.___(ICRF)___DEC =
  Astrometric right ascension and declination of the target center with
respect to the observing site (coordinate origin) in the reference frame of
the planetary ephemeris (ICRF). Compensated for down-leg light-time delay
aberration.

  Units: RA  in decimal degrees (ddd.fffff)
         DEC in decimal degrees (sdd.fffff)

 dRA*cosD d(DEC)/dt =
  The angular rate of change in apparent RA and DEC (airless) of target center.
d(RA)/dt is multiplied by the cosine of declination to provide a linear rate.
  Units: ARCSECONDS PER HOUR

 Azi_(a-appr)_Elev =
  Airless apparent azimuth and elevation of target center. Compensated
for light-time, the gravitational deflection of light, stellar aberration,
precession and nutation. Azimuth is measured clockwise from north:

  North(0) -> East(90) -> South(180) -> West(270) -> North (360)

Elevation angle is with respect to a plane perpendicular to the reference
surface local zenith direction. TOPOCENTRIC ONLY.  Units: DEGREES

 a-mass mag_ex =
    RELATIVE optical airmass and visual magnitude extinction. Airmass is the
ratio between the absolute optical airmass for the target's refracted CENTER
point to the absolute optical airmass at zenith. Also output is the estimated
visual magnitude extinction due to the atmosphere, as seen by the observer.
AVAILABLE ONLY FOR TOPOCENTRIC EARTH SITES WHEN THE TARGET IS ABOVE THE
HORIZON.  Units: none (airmass) and magnitudes (extinction).

 APmag S-brt =
   Asteroid's approximate apparent visual magnitude & surface brightness:
   APmag = H + 5*log10(delta) + 5*log10(r) - 2.5*log10((1-G)*phi1 + G*phi2)
For solar phase angles > 90 deg, the error could exceed 1 magnitude. For
phase angles > 120 degrees, output values are rounded to the nearest integer
to indicate the errors could be large and unknown.
   Units: NONE & VISUAL MAGNITUDES PER SQUARE ARCSECOND

 Illu% =
   Fraction of target circular disk illuminated by Sun (phase), as seen by
observer.  Units: PERCENT

 hEcl-Lon hEcl-Lat =
    Geometric heliocentric J2000 ecliptic longitude and latitude of target
center at the instant light leaves it to be observed at print time (print time
minus 1-way light-time).  Units: DEGREES

 r       rdot =
   Heliocentric range ("r", light-time corrected) and range-rate ("rdot")
of the target center at the instant light seen by the observer at print-time
would have left the target center (print-time minus down-leg light-time).
The Sun-to-target distance traveled by a ray of light emanating from the
center of the Sun that reaches the target center point at some instant and
is recordable by the observer one down-leg light-time later at print-time.
Units: AU and KM/S

 delta  deldot =
   Range ("delta") and range-rate ("delta-dot") of target center with respect
to the observer at the instant light seen by the observer at print-time would
have left the target center (print-time minus down-leg light-time); the
distance traveled by a light ray emanating from the center of the target and
recorded by the observer at print-time. "deldot" is a projection of the
velocity vector along this ray, the light-time-corrected line-of-sight from
the coordinate center, and indicates relative motion. A positive "deldot"
means the target center is moving away from the observer (coordinate center).
A negative "deldot" means the target center is moving toward the observer.
Units: AU and KM/S

 1-way_down_LT =
   1-way down-leg light-time from target center to observer. The elapsed time
since light (observed at print-time) would have left or reflected off a point
at the center of the target. Units: MINUTES

 S-O-T /r =
    Sun-Observer-Target angle; target's apparent SOLAR ELONGATION seen from
the observer location at print-time. Angular units: DEGREES

    The '/r' column indicates the target's apparent position relative to
the Sun in the observer's sky, as described below:

    For an observing location on the surface of a rotating body
(considering its rotational sense):

    /T indicates target TRAILS Sun (evening sky; rises and sets AFTER Sun)
    /L indicates target LEADS Sun  (morning sky; rises and sets BEFORE Sun)

For an observing point NOT on a rotating body (such as a spacecraft), the
"leading" and "trailing" condition is defined by the observer's
heliocentric orbital motion: if continuing in the observer's current
direction of heliocentric motion would encounter the target's apparent
longitude first, followed by the Sun's, the target LEADS the Sun as seen by
the observer. If the Sun's apparent longitude would be encountered first,
followed by the target's, the target TRAILS the Sun.

NOTE: The S-O-T solar elongation angle is numerically the minimum
separation angle of the Sun and target in the sky in any direction. It
does NOT indicate the amount of separation in the leading or trailing
directions, which are defined in the equator of a spherical coordinate
system.

 S-T-O =
   "S-T-O" is the Sun->Target->Observer angle; the interior vertex angle at
target center formed by a vector to the apparent center of the Sun at
reflection time on the target and the apparent vector to the observer at
print-time. Slightly different from true PHASE ANGLE (requestable separately)
at the few arcsecond level in that it includes stellar aberration on the
down-leg from target to observer.  Units: DEGREES

 PsAng   PsAMV =
   The position angles of the extended Sun->target radius vector ("PsAng")
and the negative of the target's heliocentric velocity vector ("PsAMV"),
as seen in the observer's plane-of-sky, measured CCW (east) from reference
frame North Celestial Pole. Primarily intended for ACTIVE COMETS, "PsAng"
is an indicator of the comet's gas-tail orientation in the sky (being in
the anti-sunward direction) while "PsAMV" is an indicator of dust-tail
orientation.  Units: DEGREES

 ObsEcLon    ObsEcLat =
   Observer-centered Earth ecliptic-of-date longitude and latitude of the
target center's apparent position, adjusted for light-time, the gravitational
deflection of light and stellar aberration. Although centered on the observer,
the values are expressed relative to coordinate basis directions defined by
the Earth's true equator-plane, equinox direction, and mean ecliptic plane at
print time.  Units: DEGREES

 GlxLon GlxLat =
   Observer-centered Galactic System II (post WW II) longitude and latitude
of the target center's apparent position. Adjusted for light-time,
gravitational deflection of light, and stellar aberration. Units: DEG DEG

 RA_3sigma DEC_3sigma =
  Uncertainty in Right-Ascension and Declination. Output values are the formal
+/- 3 standard-deviations (sigmas) around nominal position. Units: ARCSECONDS
